======================Polymorphism=========================
* Polymorphism : decribes the ability of an object to have
  multiple forms, that means we can have two or more objects
  that inherit from the same base class those objects can have  
  the method that has the same name but different implementation
  meaning different behavior
* means many forms and it occurs when we have many classes that
  are related to each other by inheritance. 

* the Polymorphism requires references or pointers
 if we didn't pass by reference then we're going to go back
 to using static binding even though this is virtual

========================( Virtual Member Functions)======================
    binding == liasons
* virtual = dynamic binding = overriding
*           static binding = redefining
======> How Dynamic Binding Works in C++
* you must declare a function as virtual in the bse class
* A base class pointer or reference nust be used to call the function
* Ar runtime c++ determines the actual object type (derived class) and  
  calls the appropriate overrideen function.

=======================(Virtual Destructors)========================
* the Destructors virtual to make sure that it's called when we're
  using inheritance based Polymorphism or in other words when we're
  creating a base pointer and instantiating it as some other derived 
  class type

=========================(Understanding the vtable)=================
* anytime we use the vitual keyword a virtual table is being created 
* when we call a member function, the vtbl points us to the 
  correct member function
