=========================(Abstract class)===========================
* you cannot create an instance of an abstract class base class, 
  but you can create other classes that are derived from it 
* when a class has a pure virtual function as amember it becomes an 
  abstract base class

* base-class -- abstract
* contain at least one >= pure virtual function
* only exist to be derived from
  







=========================(Pure virtual functions)===========================
* is a virtual member function that belongs to a base class and needs to be
  redefined in derived classes
