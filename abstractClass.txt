=========================(Abstract class)===========================
* you cannot create an instance of an abstract class base class, 
  but you can create other classes that are derived from it 
* when a class has a pure virtual function as a member it becomes an 
  abstract base class

* base-class -- abstract
* contain at least one >= pure virtual function
* only exist to be derived from
  
=========================(Pure virtual functions)===========================
* is a virtual member function that belongs to a base class and needs to be
  redefined in derived classes
* A pure virtual function is a function declared in a base class that has no 
  implementation in the base class and must be overridden in any derived class.

=========================(Interfaces)===========================
* Interfaces donâ€™t exist in C++98 (not even in C++20). However, 
  pure abstract classes are commonly called interfaces
